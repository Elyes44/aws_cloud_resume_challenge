# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge project repository! This project is part of the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge, which I'm undertaking to showcase my cloud skills and build my resume.

## Project Description

The AWS Cloud Resume Challenge is an initiative to demonstrate the proficiency in Amazon Web Services (AWS) by creating a simple, static website hosted on AWS services. The challenge includes several key tasks:

1. **Create a Resume Website**: Build a static website that serves as your resume. This website should include sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Experience," "Education," and "Contact."

2. **Host the Website**: Host your website on AWS. Common choices include Amazon S3 for static content hosting and Amazon Route 53 for domain registration and DNS.

3. **Set Up a Custom Domain**: Register a custom domain name and configure it to point to your hosted website.

4. **Implement HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS for your website using AWS services like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and Amazon CloudFront.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK to automate the deployment of your AWS resources.

6. **Version Control**: Use version control, such as Git, to manage your project's source code.

7. **Documentation**: Provide clear and detailed documentation about your project, its architecture, and how to set it up.
